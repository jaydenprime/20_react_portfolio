                My Name is Jayden Trinh, and I am 31 years old.
                I am currently a barber and have been in the profession for about 15 years, 8 years professioanlly.
                After being in the beauty industry for quite a while, I am no longing for a change.
                So I decided to enroll myself at UCI's coding bootcamp for fullstack development.
                I really do enjoy coding and looking foward to improving my skillset.
